            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control records changes to a file or a set of files to recall those specific files later on. A way that version control is done is through Version Control Systems. These systems are able to keep track of every version of every file that is created. This system could keep every version of an image or a design for an artist. The artist could then revert the file back to a previous state, compare changes and see where issues were first introduced. VCS also allows for one to easily recover files if they have been lost or corrupted juts by reverting back to a previous version. This is important to this class as there will be many instances when working on a project will require multiple versions. It is important that these versions of the files are able to be organized in such a way that they can be easily accesed later on if needed. A version control system is also important when working in a group as each individual can work on their own version and revert to others if they like something on the others version.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To start, many people would copy files into another directory as a method of version control. This method is simple however it is prone to errors, such as writing in or copying the wrong files. For this issue, a VCS was created to have a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. Centralized Version Control Systems were then created to allow developers to collaborate with eachother on different systems. Using this system, every developer kows what the others are doing on the project and the administrators are able to have better control over the project. However there are some downsides to this process. One is that of there is a single failure on the operation then itwill go down for all developers working on the project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began as an open source Linux Kernel and was passed around in patches and archived files. In 2002 it began as a DVCS called BitKeeper. In 2005 the realtionship of the community that made the Linux Kernel and the developer of BitKeeper broke down and as a result the program no longer became free if charge. This prompted the community to develope their own new system and they would use the information that they had used to create BitKeeper to help them create their new program. The goals of this new system was to be fast. Speed of tnransfer of information is important to developers. They also wanted to keep the dising simple. They wanted to havesupport ofr non-linear development. This was important as they wanted to have atleast thousands of parrallel branches of developers working at the same time. Git was created in 2005 and ever since thenit has been made easy to use yet still contain the core qualities that made the program useful. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git thinks of its data as snapshots in a miniature filesystem. It takes a snaphot every time you commit or save a project to keep hat version of the file at that moment. Git doesnt store the snapshot anywhere like a file, rather it just provides a link ti the previous identical file that it has already stored. Most Git operations only need local files and local resources to operate. No information is neeted form another computer so there is very little latency and operations seem almost instantaneous. Git can look at a brief history of any project by only using your local device. This process of preforming these tasks locally makes them much faster. Git actions ony ever add data to the database. This is important as it possible to deleet added data however it is very difficult to recover deleted data. After you have commited a snaphot on Git, it is very difficult to lose.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Account Setup</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To set up a Git Account, you must first make a username and password. A verify email will be then sent to your account that you provided. You will then need to create a SSH public access key to connect to the Github remote repository. After this public key has been linked from your local repository to the remote repository, your file will be able to be transfered ans stored. Github maps yur commits through your email, so it is important to link the emails with the commits properly.he top address is verified and set as the primary address, meaning that is where you’ll get any notifications and receipts. The second address is verified and so can be set as the primary if you wish to switch them. The final address is unverified, meaning that you can’t make it your primary address. If GitHub sees any of these in commit messages in any repository on the site, it will be linked to your user. Github also uses a two factor authentication security feature. This is important because if one passowrd is compromised there is still anther level of security in front to keep others out. </p>
